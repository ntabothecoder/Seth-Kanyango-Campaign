Yesterday,  1st May 2025, LABOUR DAY,  I had a rare chance of sipping from the wisdom pot of my mentor, the great teacher of all times, Ruoth,Jaduong,Chief Kogolla Thomas Thomas Kogolla at my place in Rongo town. 
We vividly remembered memories of the past. From the first day I received my letter of employment to teach at the prestigious St. Joseph's School, Rapogi under his tutelage up to the last days when he left for Ambira. 
Mzee is a symbol of honest, wise and knowledgeable leadership to us. May our dear Lord continue protecting you for us and future  generations. 
Erokamano Ruoth. Wageni.

May the Lord Jesus Christ bless you and your family, always.
